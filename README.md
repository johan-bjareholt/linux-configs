linux-configs
=============

This is a set of my linux configs.
If you want to try it, run the startup script (obviously)

####Setup script
Automatically does all the commands for me

####Dropbox symlinks
I don't want to cd to ~/Dropbox/Documents everytime, keep it simple with ~/Documents.

####Dotfile syncing
Well, noone likes to have seperate zshrcs and awesome configs right?

This is how you fast and easily manage it all like a champ!

It is based on this script: http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/
